# AES Encryption and Decryption

This project was made as part of the course, "Information Security", in seventh semester. The project required us to implement AES algorithm for encryption and decryption.

The user is first asked to enter the message and then the key. The message is first encrypted to produce the ciphertext. The ciphertext is then decrypted to reproduce the plaintext. All steps of encryption and decryption are shown
